        <h2>What about my studies?</h2>
        <p>I started off by entering a 2 year Math and Physics called "Classe Preparatoire aux Grandes Ecoles" in Paris. These two years of hard work payed off and got me into Enseeiht As a Computer Science
            student. There, I started learning about the basics of Computer Science from networks to computer architecture to data analysis and so many other subjects. Above just increasing my
            general knowledge and broadening my ideas, all these classes allowed me to work on various projects and put what I had learned in perspective. Most of these projects
            can be found on my github account if you are interested
        </p>
        <p> 
            Through much discussion and observation, I quickly figured out the most interesting course at Enseeiht for me was the Images and Multemedia one. This course would allow 
            me to learn how to work with actual data that you can see and work with. The choice was a no-brainer for me considering I love anything creative and working on pictures, sound, videos 
            or 3D models is one of the most beautiful things you can do in my eyes. The first time I got to choose completly freely a subject to work on and present, I chose to create a dataset of 
            mosaics I could find across Paris and try and train an image recognition model to recognise them. This was my first time learning about these models and it made me excited to try and get my
            project to work. That was my first push towards working with images. To be honest with you, getting into engineering school started off as a default choice being a scientific student
            but when I discovered this could be what I learn and eventually work on it got me extremly motivated and it made me realise this was definitly the right path for me to take. So, I entered
            this class in my second year at Enseeiht. Now, if you're interested in learning more you can see my cv and read about my internships and project.
