        <h2>What about going abroad?</h2>
       <p>
            There are so many beautiful countries that are all so different and from which we can always learn so much and discover so much. I have had the chance of discovering 
            a few countries so let me tell you all about it.
       </p>
       <p> 
            My first cultural experience comes from my mum. She was born in England from Scottish parents and lived in Ireland. My grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins all lived there 
            and going over to Ireland to see them was my first experience with another country than France. It always felt different but it always felt as home as well as France did. 

            Later on in life, I got to learn spanish in school and in high school I was lucky enough to go on an exchange program to Argentina. I went to spend a month with an Argentinian 
            girl my age and her family. I discovered the country, the language, the culture, the school, the people and it was such a great experience I won't ever forget. Part of that program also 
            allowed us to welcome my correspondant in our home and sharing our culture with her was also, in different ways, really enriching.

            Another incredible opportunity I got was to go to Senegal with my dad. There I got to meet lot's of very different people and it was extremly eye opening and enriching to see.
            I got to go to a primary school and give English classes teaching them songs for a few times. One of my nicest memories from that trip was when we went back about a year later 
            and I went to the same school and they could still remember the songs we had learned and sang a year ago. 

            So far these are my most enriching experiences I got to live abroad and I hope I will have more to come!
